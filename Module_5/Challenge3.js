const lyrics = [`I messed up tonight, I lost another fight, I messed up but I'll just start again, I keep falling down I keep on hitting the ground, I always get up now to see what's next. Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up.  Nobody learns without getting it wrong! I won't give up, no I won't give in, till I reach the end and then I'll start again. No I won't leave, I wanna try everything, I wanna try even though I could fail!`];
