What is Git and how is it different from GitHub?

Git is an Open Source Control System.  It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and helped developers have a full code history at their fingertips where other control systems such as SVN and CVS did not.

Github is a “Cloud Based Hosting Service” that allows you to manage Git, its repositories or repos.  It is also designed to help you manage or keep track of changes made to Git.

Why use the terminal?

The terminal allows lots of setting and structure options that allow a great deal of control over appearance and each of the profiles—by using PowerShell.

The terminal is also known as the CLI or the Command Line Interface; it provides access to the interface and allows better access to the actual power of the computer—better than the GUI, Graphical User Interface; which uses pictures to help the average user to navigate the screen better.

Explain 3 benefits of Version Control.  (In your own words.)

Version Control is key for documents needed to go thru a redrafting and electronic docs because they can simply be modified by alternate users.

Version Control Benefits are:

a. A great way of keeping track of building applications by being able to id which version is in development.

b. Allows you to merge changes, codes, files and assets; compare files and id differences—if needed before committing any code.

c. Helps you to keep track of every team member and what version they are working on.
